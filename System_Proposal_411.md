# 1. System Request
Project Sponsor: Bryan Birch, Jacob Hamm, Noah Barrall, Michael Keeports <br> <br>
Business Need: This project has been initiated to help confusion for CIS students at Messiah University when it comes to finding information for course registration. Currently there are over three different systems used for finding course registration information, and those systems are not always up to date or they can conflict with one another. <br> <br>

Business Requirement: This application will solve these needs by creating a new source of information for course registration that will combine the existing sources into one to be used by CIS students and faculty. <br> <br>

Business Values: Students will benefit with less stress and confusion when it comes to course registration. This will also allow to students to register much more efficiently. Faculty will benefit with more structure and less confusion in the process for course registration, as well as helping in meetings between students and their advisors. <br> <br>

Special Issues or Constraints: The capabilities described are limited to those in the CIS department currently, but this system is to be designed to be replicated and expanded to other departments in the future. One issue for this project is integrating the information from the current systems into this application.
